At OopsScoop, we offer two convenient options for your dog waste removal needs: weekly pickup and one-time pickup. Our weekly pickup service starts at just $25, giving you the peace of mind of a clean yard every week. If you prefer a one-time pickup, we offer that too! For just $110, we'll come and clean up your yard in no time.
<br /><br />
Do you have multiple dogs? No problem! For each additional dog, we charge an additional $10. And for your convenience, you have the option to have us take the bagged dog waste with us for an extra $10, or we can leave it in your waste bin. Please note that prices may vary if your yard is larger than .25 acre, or if the dog waste cleaning exceeds one hour.
<br /><br />
Don't let dog waste ruin your outdoor space. Contact us today to schedule your first pickup and experience the OopsScoop difference. We look forward to serving you!
